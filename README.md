# Platformer-in-Raylib
A little platformer written with C++, Raylib, and rlmGui!
**Work in Progress!!**

**Features:**
  
  - GUI level editing system that saves levels to text files
  - Pressing space switches levels
  - Cutom Made Tiles
  - Collisions
  - ImGui and rlImGui integration
  - GUI Level Editing System  
  - Half-Baked Animations
  
**For Next Update:**
  
  - More Levels
  - Actual Level Switching System

**For the future:**

  - Cool movement tech

That's it! The game engine is, at least to my standards, basically finished!!\
The only feature missing is a level switching system

**Build Instructions:**\
This project is built with Cmake!\
To build it from source, download the code, open a new terminal in the folder and run the following commands:\
`mkdr build`\
`cd build`\
`cmake ..`\
`cmake --build .`

It should just compile! If not check if cmake & raylib are installed

**Made with ❤️ (& Visual Studio Code)**
